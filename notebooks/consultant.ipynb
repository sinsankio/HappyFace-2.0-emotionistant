      "2. Practice self-compassion. It's easy to be hard on ourselves when we're feeling fearful or anxious, but it's essential to remember that everyone experiences these emotions from time to time. Speak to yourself as you would to a friend, offering kindness and understanding.\n",
      "3. Develop coping strategies. This could include deep breathing exercises, mindfulness, or progressive muscle relaxation techniques to help manage your anxiety.\n",

      "Regarding your anger towards your toxic friends, it's important to prioritize your emotional well-being. You might consider the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Set boundaries. It's okay to limit your exposure to people who negatively impact your emotional state. This could mean spending less time with them or declining invitations to events where they'll be present.\n",
      "2. Communicate your feelings. If it feels safe and appropriate to do so, express your concerns to your friends. They may not realize the impact of their behavior, and having an open conversation could lead to improved relationships.\n",
      "3. Seek support. Surround yourself with people who uplift and encourage you. This could include family members, other friends, or a therapist who can provide a safe space to process your emotions.\n",
